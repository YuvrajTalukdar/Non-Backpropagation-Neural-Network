# Non-Backpropagation-Neural-Network
A new type of artificial neutral network designed to recognize patterns in data and use it to make classification in the dataset. The algorithm can train and perform prediction on labeled data without using the backpropagation algorithm. Data with labels are fed into the algorithm. It trains on the data and learns its pattern. Next time when data without labels are feed in, it can predict the label with high degree of accuracy. The algorithm takes inspiration from natural neural networks in brain, but many components of the algorithm is artificial.  This neural network does not use the backpropagation algorithm or any other currently known algorithm for optimization. It uses is own special technique for the process. The simplex algorithm is an important component of the algorithm. It is combined with other entirely new algorithms designed to be used in this algorithm.
